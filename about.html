    <div class="aboutSub">
        <p class="aboutText">Pineapple started as a small business of only 5 people who were obsessed with technology.
            A lot of us grew up as kids. We've had all sorts of phones from iPhones to Androids. We
            knew that people would always argue about which one was better. So we thought... what if
            we created something that a majority of people enjoy? And voil√†! We created Pineapple.

    <div class="aboutSub">
        <p class="aboutText">Pineapple isn't just a new random phone company. We believe we're the best one out there.
            To prove it, we've hired the best engineers from around the world to come work on our products.
            We've gotten interviews from a lot of major news sources such as Fox, CNN, New York Times, HBO,
            plenty more! So we'd like to say we're the new wave.

        <p class="aboutText">The thing is when a new company gains popularity, there's got to be a reason why right? We
            wanted to create a device that impresses people by the day. We have the highest tech gear
            in the country so people can focus more on activities rather than "Why is my device lagging??" So what are
            you waiting for? Place a Pineapple order now! We're appreciative of all of our supporters and can't wait for
            you all to see what we'll have
            in the future as well!
